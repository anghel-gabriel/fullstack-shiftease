# Developer's Contribution

## External Libraries Used

- **PrimeNG:** My favourite Angular component library.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Used to style what PrimeNG couldn't. More efficient than SCSS - less code, not moving between HTML and SCSS files.
- **File-saver and XLSX:** To export shifts to Excel files.
- **Firebase:** To handle authentication, to store, sync, and query data from everywhere.
- **chart.js:** For creating charts and graphs.

## Features of Angular Used

- Template driven forms.
- Services, observables.
- Some new Angular syntax (e.g., `@ngIf`).
- rxJS, for reactive programming.
- Pipes (mostly date pipe variations).
- Guards.

## Areas for Improvement

- Improve security.
- Improve fetching.
- Improve type checking.
- Improve code quality.
